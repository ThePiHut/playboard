# PLAY BOARD

[PLAY BOARD](https://www.thepihut.com/playboard) is a break-out board for
Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, providing crocodile clip connectors for easily
connecting simple GPIO components to the Raspberry Pi.

Since the board simply breaks out GPIO pins, any standard GPIO software is
supported, and no special software is required beyond what is included in
Raspbian. Examples are provided for Scratch 2 and Python (GPIO Zero):

- [Scratch](scratch.md)
- [Python](python.md)

## GPIO reference

PLAY BOARD provides four GPIO pads: 10, 11, 12 and 13 (using BCM numbering, as
this is used by both Scratch 2 and GPIO Zero).

The board also provides pads for GND and 3V3, which can be shared by multiple
components.
